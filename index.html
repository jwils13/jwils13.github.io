  <h1>Jaden Wilson</h1>
    <h3>ICS4U Portfolio</h3>
  <p>Hello, my name is Jaden Wilson, this year I took grade 12 computer science and I thoroughly enjoyed the class! I wanted to demonstrate some of my favourite things I learned through the year. Below I have listed my top 10 favourite modules we covered in the course.</p>

  <h1>My top 10 Modules</h1>
	
	<div class="mod">
		<h3>1. Algorithms</h3>
		<p>This module was without a doubt the best part of the course for me, it helped me better grasp concepts of computer science and it was a very fun way to do it! I had already had an idea of algorithms and how they worked, but this course taught me just how important they are, and used a logic based method to improve your coding skills and at the same time working your brain. The cubing we did throughout the course did a good job getting your brain to work out logic to make a solution to a problem you face often, you would see a certain pattern on a repeated basis and you would lean how to get past wherever you were stuck. Eventually after repeating the same algorithms they would stick in my brain, my cubing times got much faster and cleaner, and the cubing skills I developped are a strong reasons for how my coding skills increased throughout this course.

		<h3>2. Perlin Noise</h3>
		<p>I really enjoyed the time we took to delve into the idea of perlin noise, demonstrated in Dan Shiffman's perlin noise flow field coding challenge. Perlin noise is used to create natural looking motion, recreating the way textures appear in nature. This concept was really interesting to me, so I really enjoyed working with it.

		<h3>3. Natural Simulations</h3>
		<p>As someone who finds great interest in physics, I really enjoyed this module since it allowed me to combine computer science concepts with some mathematical concepts that are used in physics such as forces, gravity and vectors. This module just took little things that interested me outside of coding and brought them into that world, which proved for an interesting an fun time spent learning natural simulations.

	<div class="mod">
		<h3>4. Hackathon</h3>
		<p>The time we spent learning both what a hackathon is and doing one ourselves was one of my favourite parts of a class. I like the idea of a group of people coming together and sharing ideas they had and what they made with both their coding skill and their creativity.
	</div>
	
	<div class="mod">
		<h3>5. Live Coding Session</h3>
		<p>I liked this concept and when it came to actually performing the live coding sessions I was pleasantly suprised. The idea of it is very good, a group starting from scratch and learning out to make something from nothing all together, however I did find sometimes in a time crunch it can be difficult to fit in everything you want to and to keep up with everyone sometimes.

	<div class="mod">
		<h3>6. Learning How to Make a Website</h3>
		<p>This is a good project to talk about making a website on! The part I liked about learning to make a website in this course was good because I love the simplicity of it. The basics of what it takes to make a website is very simple and easy for anyone to do, but starting from the building blocks of building a website, you can customise it to fit the theme you want to convey with that website, and there's just so many ways to build off of it, that's why it's one of my favourite modules of this course.

	<div class="mod">
		<h3>7. Random Numbers</h3>
		<p>Throughout this course with what we learned, my knowlege on random numbers has elevated a lot. I like the concept of randomness, and always seemed like it was difficult to grasp true randomness, but now after the time I've spent with random numbesr this course, it makes a lot more sense of what "randomness" is and how it works.
	</div>
	
	<div class="mod">
		<h3>8. Animations</h3>
		<p>This course taught me about animations and much of the visual aspect of virtual creations. I really enjoyed the time I spend learning how to animate objects based on certain criteria as well as making that criteria myself so that something moves exactly how I want it to without failure. From the many things I'll take away from this course, animation I feel will be one of the most useful and interesting.

	<div class="mod">
		<h3>9. Game Development</h3>
		<p>In the previous computer science courses I've taken, game development has always been a topic I've been very interesteddd in, and the time spent learning it has always been a highlight of those courses for me. As the courses have gone on, my understanding of games and game development has increased more and more over time, and this course was a huge step for me. I learned drastically new and interesting conceps related game design and after this course I cannot wait to learn more and continue developing my skills in that field.

	<div class="mod">
		<h3>10. Managing data and Github</h3>
		<p>During this course we worked a lot with github and data. For the first time in a computer science course, I used github as a primary tool for my learning, and I'll definitely continue using it after this course. A great example is when we did our cubing, I would time myself and keep all my times in a github repository so that I can look back on how I've improved over the semester. Simple things like that are what make github such a brilliant tool in both professional and personal life, so it had to make my top 10.
